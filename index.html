<p>Our project aims at exploring the status of women in the world of movies. 
  We want to analyze how they appear, in acting, directing and writing. 
  We want to see how the ratings, as well as the genre of their movies are compared to those of men. 
  We also use term frequency - inverse document frequency analysis to see which words are the most likely 
  to be used in the user reviews, and check the sentiment of the reviews. <br/> <br/> Getting the data for our project 
  was the biggest challenge. It was very hard to acquire some user reviews, which we considered the biggest part 
  of the task, but finally we were able to get them from The Movie Database. We get lists of movies made in 
  specific years from Wikipedia, information about the movies returned from The Open Movie Database (an imdb API), 
  and to determine which gender the people on our list are, we (partly) use a name gender API which only allows 
  1000 requests a day. Some harder names were also gender-determined by hand.

  As all the data was aquired from various websites, it's not possible to provide a download link for the dataset, it was never downloaded.
  However, if a user is very determined to access the data, it is of course an option to go through all of the notebooks, and extract
  the data from the websites in the same way as done there. We provide three notebooks. In the first, the data is extracted, the second contains graphs and text analysis, and the third one contains the network analysis. <br/>
